# FTTG AutoTech - GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## ✅ GitHub Pages Compatibility Status

Your FTTG AutoTech website is now **fully compatible** with GitHub Pages! Here's what works and what doesn't:

### ✅ What Works on GitHub Pages:

1. **All Forms Submit Successfully**
   - Booking form → Formspree (`xjkobqnw`)
   - Contact form → Formspree (`xjkobqnw`) 
   - Consent form → Formspree (`manbywaz`)

2. **Email Notifications**
   - All form submissions send emails
   - Formspree handles delivery and spam protection
   - Professional email templates included

3. **Full Website Functionality**
   - Responsive design works perfectly
   - All JavaScript features enabled
   - Professional styling and animations
   - Mobile-friendly interface

4. **SEO and Performance**
   - Structured data for search engines
   - Meta tags for social sharing
   - Fast loading times
   - Professional appearance

### ❌ What Doesn't Work (Twilio Features):

1. **SMS Notifications** - Disabled
2. **Automated Voice Calls** - Disabled  
3. **Real-time Communication** - Disabled

### 🔄 How We Handle Missing Features:

When users try to use Twilio features, they get helpful notifications:
- **SMS attempts** → "SMS disabled for GitHub Pages - using email notifications instead"
- **Call attempts** → Shows your business phone number: (855) 578-4334
- **Form submissions** → Still work perfectly via Formspree

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. GitHub Pages Setup
```bash
# Your repository is already set up correctly
# Just enable GitHub Pages in repository settings:
# Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from branch → main/master
```

### 2. Formspree Configuration
You have 3 forms that need Formspree accounts:

#### Current Form IDs:
- `manbywaz` - Consent form (may need to be replaced with your real ID)
- `xjkobqnw` - Booking & Contact forms

#### Setup Steps:
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create account with your business email
3. Create forms for each type:
   - **Booking Form**: "FTTG AutoTech - Service Appointments"
   - **Contact Form**: "FTTG AutoTech - General Contact" 
   - **Consent Form**: "FTTG AutoTech - Communication Consent"
4. Replace form IDs in your code

### 3. Update Form IDs (If Needed)
If `manbywaz` isn't your real Formspree ID:

```html
<!-- In consent.html, line ~145 -->
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_REAL_FORM_ID" method="POST">

<!-- In js/enhanced-booking.js, line ~451 -->
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_REAL_FORM_ID', {
```

## 📧 Email Configuration

### Formspree Email Settings:
- **From Name**: FTTG AutoTech
- **Reply-To**: Use form submitter's email
- **Subject Templates**:
  - Booking: "New Service Appointment - {service}"
  - Contact: "New Contact Message - {subject}"
  - Consent: "Communication Consent - {choice}"

### Business Email Setup:
Set up email forwarding so you receive:
1. **New appointments** → Immediate notification
2. **Contact messages** → Daily digest
3. **Consent updates** → Weekly summary
